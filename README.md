# Josephson Junction optimization via enhanced Shortcuts to Adiabaticity
In this repo I will try to use [eSTA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06057) to minimize the decoherence of the final state of the system.
The pdf notes can be found in the `Notes` folder, while the `Documents` is the folder where I store what can be thought as a diary. Its content is made of 
1. `physicsannotation.md` where I write down all the problems I am having from a physics point of view (change of variables, differentiation you name it)
2. `annotations.md` is a file where I track all the progresses from a coding  point of view (how I solved this or that, where I optimized the code etc. etc.)

Finally, the `Data` folder is where I store the data files I will then use for postprocessing.
