I need to write down how they managed to get from the non approximated version of the Hamiltonian to the STA one  that looks like an harmonic oscillator but I will do that later.
First I will make some calculations for eSTA in order to hopefully get some results.

The problem I had with the floating `N` has been found. I forgot to collect the N/2 term from each of the parenthesis inside the square root and hence I did not get the N^2 term.
The issue is now solved
