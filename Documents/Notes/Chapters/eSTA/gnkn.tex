The wavefunctions \cref{eq:STAWavefunctionBoseHubbard} and the two Hamiltonians are the starting points to evaluate the eSTA corrections.
These corrections are calculated by making approximation about the value of the fidelity landscape and we need to define some variables conveniently.
In particular we need
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\Delta H$ which is the difference between the two Hamiltonians $ H _{0}$
\end{itemize}
