Layout of the chapter is the following
% First I introduce the stuff that I need to calculate the corrections.
% i.e. H0, Hs as  well as the STA wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator and how they are written in terms of the JJ
\section{eSTA Calculations}

\subsection{Introduction} % Introduction and definitions of the STA wavefunctions

\subsection{Nice properties of the integrals} % List of all the properties of the integrals that will help speed up the calculation
