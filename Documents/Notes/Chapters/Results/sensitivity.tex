We can also check the performance with this quantity that encompasses both the fidelity as well as the robustness of a protcol.
We are going to define the following quantity
\begin{equation}
	\eta = \sqrt{(1-F)^{2} + R^{2}}
	\label{eq:Sensitivity}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the fidelity and $ R $  is the robustness.
The results are shown in the following plots for different number of particles and for different eSTA.
