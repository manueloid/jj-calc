In this section we will go through all the tests and results we obtained applying the eSTA protocol to the Josephson Junction system.
We checked the performances of the eSTA approach for both the original formulation of eSTA as well as for the eSTA protocol with the Hessian formalism as explained in \cref{sec:eSTAFormulation}
In addition, we obtained the corrections by applying eSTA to two different Hamiltonians against the reference \cref{eq:HamiltonianJosephsonJunctionHarmonic}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The original Hamiltonian of the Josephson Junction (in its continuous form) \cref{eq:SchrodingerEquationCoefficientsContinuous}
	\item The approximated Hamiltonian \cref{eq:TaylorExpansionHamiltonian}
\end{itemize}
Finally, we also checked how the number of correction paramters affected the performances of the eSTA protocol.
We will start with the fidelity and then we move on and check the robustness with respect to noise.
