\section{Josephson Junction from the ground-up}
Here I will summarize the paper \cite{ABosonicJosepGati2007} where the Josephson Junction is derived.
We are considering  $ N $  particles in a double well potential, the form of which is
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:HamiltonianDoubleWell}
	V_{dw} = \frac{1}{2} m \left(\omega^2_{x} x^2 + \omega^2_{y} y^2 + \omega^2_{z} z^2\right) + \frac{V_{0}}{2} \left(1 + \cos\frac{2\pi}{d_{sw}} x\right).
\end{equation}
Usually this problem is really hard to solve at involves many body particles etc. However the single particle spectrum of the double well is almost degenerate for the first two levels, while there is a wide gap between the second and third eigentates of the double well Hamiltonian.
This allows us to introduce the \textit{two mode approximation} in which only the first two eigentates are considered.
It has been shown how with this assumption the Hamiltonian of the system can be written as
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:HamiltonianDoubleWellIntegral}
	 & H = \hat{ H }_{0} + \hat{ H }_{int}                                                                                                                         \\
	 & \hat{H}_{0} = \int_{}^{}  \mathrm{d\mathbf{r}}\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \hat{\Psi}^{\dag}\nabla^2\hat{ \Psi } + \hat{\Psi}^{\dag}V_{dw}\hat{ \Psi }\right)	, \\
	 & \hat{H}_{int} = \frac{g}{2}\int \mathrm{d\mathbf{r}} \hat{\Psi}^{\dag}\hat{\Psi}^{\dag}\hat{ \Psi }\hat{ \Psi }
\end{align}
with $ \hat{\Psi} $ field operator that (loosely speaking) creates / annihilates a particle in the position $ \mathbf{r} $ and $ g $ is the coupling constant.
Now we take into account only the mean-field ground and excited states (which I assume they are $\Phi_g = \ket{N,0}$ and  $\Phi_e = \ket{0,N})$ so we can rewrite the general wavefunction $\hat{ \Psi }$ as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:GeneralState}
	\hat{\Psi} = \hat{c}_{g}\Phi_g + \hat{c}_{e}\Phi_e
\end{equation}
with $\hat{c}_g^{\dagger} $ and $\hat{c}_e^{\dagger} $ the creation operator for the ground and excited states respectively.
A more convenient choice in this case is usually to choose the left and right operators
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:LeftRightOperators}
	\hat{c}_l^{\dagger} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}  }\left( \hat{c}_g^{\dagger} + \hat{c}_e^{\dagger} \right)   \hspace{3em}\hat{c}_r^{\dagger} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}  }\left( \hat{c}_g^{\dagger} - \hat{c}_e^{\dagger} \right)  .
\end{equation}
With this choice, we can now rewrite $ \hat{\Psi} $
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:LeftRightPsi}
	\hat{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \hat{c}_l(\Phi_g + \Phi_e) + \hat{c}_r(\Phi_g - \Phi_e) \right).
\end{equation}
We are now in the position to insert \cref{eq:LeftRightPsi} into \cref{eq:HamiltonianDoubleWellIntegral} and by doing some calculations, we obtain the two-mode Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:HamiltonianTwoMode}
	\hat{H}_{2M} = \frac{E_{c}}{8}\left(\hat{c}_{r}^\dagger\hat{c}_{r} - \hat{c}_{l}^\dagger\hat{c}_{l}\right)^2 - \frac{ E_{j} }{N} \left(\hat{c}_{l}^\dagger\hat{c}_{r} - \hat{c}_{r}^\dagger\hat{c}_{l}\right) + \frac{\delta E}{4} \left(\hat{c}_{l}^\dagger\hat{c}_{r} - \hat{c}_{r}^\dagger\hat{c}_{l}\right)^{2}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
	\item $ E_{j} $ describes the tunneling rate from one well to the other.
	\item $ E_{c} $ corresponds to the local interaction within the two wells.
	\item $ \delta E $ takes into account additional two-particles processes.
\end{itemize}
In many discussions, the last term $ \delta E $ is often neglected and thus the Hamiltonian \cref{eq:HamiltonianTwoMode} can be further simplified and becomes
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:HamiltonianTwoModeFinal}
	\hat{H}_{2M} = \frac{E_{c}}{2} \hat{n}^2 - \frac{2E_{j}}{N}\hat{\alpha}
\end{equation}
with $ \hat{n}^2 $ the population imbalance and $\hat{\alpha}$ the tunneling operator.
Their form is
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:JosephsonJuncitionOperators}
	\hat{n} = \frac{\hat{c}_{r}^\dagger\hat{c}_{r} - \hat{c}_{l}^\dagger\hat{c}_{l}}{2}, \hspace{3em} \hat{ \alpha } = \frac{ \hat{c}_{l}^\dagger\hat{c}_{r} + \hat{c}_{r}^\dagger\hat{c}_{l}}{2}
\end{equation}
and we will see that these two operators are basically the same thing as the ones in  \cite{FastGenerationJulia2012}
\newpage
\section{Josephson Junction Approximation}

\subsection{JJ in angular momentum formalism}
In this section we will outline the calculations that allow STA to be applied in these Josephson Junction settings.
%Full Hamiltonian of the system
Starting from \cref{eq:HamiltonianTwoModeFinal} it can be shown that the operators $ \hat{n} $ and $ \hat{ \alpha } $ behave as pseudoangular momentum operators if we set
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:PseudoAngularMomentumDefinition}
	\hat{J}_z = \frac{\hat{c}_{r}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{r} - \hat{c}_{l}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{l}}{2} = \hat{n},\hspace{3em} \hat{J}_x =\frac{\hat{c}_{r}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{l} - \hat{c}_{l}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{r}}{2} =  \hat{ \alpha }  ,\hspace{3em}  \hat{J}_y = \frac{\hat{c}_{r}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{l} - \hat{c}_{l}^{\dagger}\hat{c}_{r}}{2i}
\end{equation}
and we obtain the Bose Hubbard Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:HamiltonianJosephsonJunctionSTA}
	H_{BH} =  U \hat{J}_z^2 - 2J\hat{J}_x
\end{equation}
if the value $ U $ and $ J $ are chosen accordingly.
It can also be shown that the operators defined in \cref{eq:PseudoAngularMomentumDefinition} follow in fact the angular momentum relations.\\
%Description of the basis states 
By using the pseudoangular momentum approach, a system of N particles can be described as a single particle with spin $ N/2 $ and the basis set is of the form $ \{\ket{m}\} $ with $ m = -N/2, ..., N/2 $ eigenstates of the $ \hat{J}_{z} $ operator.\\
The Hamiltonian of the system is then defined via \cref{eq:HamiltonianJosephsonJunctionSTA} and the general state $ \ket{\Psi} $ can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:GeneralStateAngularMomentum}
	\ket{\Psi} = \sum_{m = -N/2}^{N/2} c_{m}\ket{m}.
\end{equation}
% Schr{\"o}dinger equation 
The Schr{\"o}dinger equation is then written as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:SchrodingerEquationBoseHubbardAngular}
	i\partial_t \ket{\Psi} = H_{BH}\ket{\Psi}
\end{equation}
If we want to apply STA to \cref{eq:SchrodingerEquationBoseHubbardAngular}, we need to perform some approximations.
In the following I will try to perform the same approximation they used in \cite{BoseEinsteinCJulia2010} in order to move from the discrete to the continuous variable.
I will follow the calculations I found in \cite{BoseEinsteinCJulia2010} as they give a better idea on what is the Hamiltonian of the system and what are the steps and approximations we need to make in order to obtain an idealised version of the Hamiltonian where we can apply STA.
My plan is to obtain the idealised version of the Hamiltonian they used in \cite{FastGenerationJulia2012}.
The first thing to do is to define a new dimensionless Hamiltonian $ H_{S} = \frac{H_{BH}}{NJ} $ that reads
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:DimensionlessBoseHubbardHamiltonian}
	H_{S} = -\frac{2}{N}\hat{J}_x +\frac{U}{NJ}\hat{J}_z ^{2} = -\frac{2}{N} \hat{J}+ \frac{2\Lambda}{N^2}\hat{J}_z^2
\end{equation}
where we defined $ \Lambda = NU/(2J) $.
The corresponding Schr{\"o}dinger equation then becomes $ \frac{i}{NJ}\partial_t\ket{\Psi} = H_{S}\ket{\Psi} $ and if we introduce the dimensionless time $ \tau = t/J $, it simplifies even more, becoming
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:SchrodingerEquationDimensionless}
	\frac{i}{N}\partial_{\tau} \ket{\Psi} =
	\left(
	-\frac{2}{N} \hat{J}_{x}+ \frac{2\Lambda}{N^2}\hat{J}_z^2
	\right)\ket{\Psi}
\end{equation}

\subsection{JJ Hamiltonian in continous variables}
%Applying angular momentum operators  
We now want to find a differential equation for the coefficients $ c_{m} $ of \cref{eq:GeneralStateAngularMomentum}.
In order to do that, we are going to project \cref{eq:SchrodingerEquationDimensionless} onto $ \bra{m} $.
Moreover, we are going to use the fact that $ \hat{J}_x = \frac{1}{2}\left(\hat{J}_{+} + \hat{J}_{-}\right) $.
If we are to project onto $ \bra{m} $ we should remember how the ladder operators $ \hat{J}_{\pm} $ act.
In particular, we can see we are only interested in those states $ \ket{k} $ such that $ \hat{J}_{\pm}\ket{k} = \beta_{k} \ket{m} $ with $ \beta_{k} $ some coefficient depending on the quantum number $ k $.
We are interested in such states as they are the ones which the projection on $ \bra{m} $ is non zero and we can see that for a fixed $ m $   only the states $ \ket{m \pm 1} $ meet the requirements.
Take for example $ \ket{m +1} $ then
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:LadderOperatorsProjected}
	\braket{m|\hat{J}_{-} |m + 1 } = \sqrt{
		\left(\frac{N}{2} + m +1\right)
		\left(\frac{N}{2} -m\right)
	}
	\braket{m|m}
	=
	\beta_{m}
\end{equation}
where we set $ \beta_{m} =\sqrt {    \left(\frac{N}{2} + m +1\right)  \left(\frac{N}{2} -m\right) }$.\\

% Discrete formulation for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation
By putting everything back together, we obtain
\begin{align}
	 & \braket{m|\frac{i}{N}\partial_t|\Psi} = \braket{m|\tilde{H}_{S}|\Psi}\label{eq:SchrodingerEquationCoefficientsDiscrete1}                                                               \\
	 & \frac{i}{N}\frac{d}{dt}c_{m}(t) =  -\frac{2}{N}\left( b_{m}c_{m+1}(t) + b_{m-1}c_{m-1}(t) \right) + \frac{2\Lambda}{N^2}m^2c_{m}(t)\label{eq:SchrodingerEquationCoefficientsDiscrete2}
\end{align}
where in this case we set $ b_{m} = \beta_m/N $.
The result in \cref{eq:SchrodingerEquationCoefficientsDiscrete2} gives us a Schr{\"o}dinger equation for the coefficients $ c_{m} $ which is discrete. We now need to move from a discrete formualtion to a continuous one and we are going to do that by performing a change of variable.
If we look at the definition of $ b_{m} $, we see that we can collect the $ N/2 $ term as shown in the following
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:CoefficientCollectingN}
	b_m =\frac{1}{N}\sqrt{
		\left(\frac{N}{2} + m +1\right)  \left(\frac{N}{2} -m\right)
	}  =
	\frac{1}{N}\sqrt{
		\frac{N^2}{4}
		\left(1 + \frac{m}{N/2} +\frac{1}{N/2}\right)
		\left(1 -\frac{m}{N/2}\right)
	}
\end{equation}
and if we define the continuous variable $ z = \frac{m}{N/2} $  and $ h = \frac{1}{N/2} $, we obtain
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:CoefficientContinuous}
	\frac{1}{2}
	\sqrt{
		\left(1 + z +h\right)
		\left(1 -z\right)
	}
	:=  b_{h}(z)
\end{equation}
where we can see that $ b_{h}(z-h) = \sqrt{ \left(1 + z \right)\left(1 -z -h\right) } $ which can be mapped back to $ b_{m-1} $.
Additionaly, if we define $ \sqrt{N/2}  c_{m}= \psi(z) $ we see that $ \psi(z \pm h) $ can be mapped to $ c_{m\pm 1} $.
Finally, by recalling that for a function $f(x)$ we have $ f(x \pm \epsilon) = e^{\pm \epsilon\partial_{x}}f(x) $ we can rewrite \cref{eq:SchrodingerEquationCoefficientsDiscrete2} as
\begin{equation} %	\label{eq:SchrodingerEquationCoefficientsContinuous}
	\label{eq:SchrodingerEquationCoefficientsContinuous}
	\cancel{\frac{1}{2}}ih\partial_t\psi(z) =
	-\cancel{\frac{1}{2}}[ e^{-i\hat{p}} b_{h}(z) + b_{h}(z)e^{i\hat{p}} ]\psi(z) +
	\cancel{\frac{1}{2}}\Lambda z^2 \psi(z)
\end{equation}
where $ \hat{p} = -ih\partial_z $.
\subsection{Approximation to Harmonic Oscillator}
If we want to mimic the calculations made in \cite{FastGenerationJulia2012} we need to perform a Taylor expansion of both the $ e^{\pm i\hat{p}} $ part and the $ b_{h}(z) $ function up to the second order in $ h $ such as
\begin{align}
	 & e^{-i\hat{p}}  \simeq 1 \pm h \partial_{z} - \frac{1}{2}h^2\partial^2_{z} \label{eq:TaylorExpansionExp }                         \\
	 & b_{h}(z) \simeq  1 + h \partial_{h}b_{h}(z)|_{h = 0} + \frac{1}{2}h^2\partial_h^2b_{h}(z)|_{h = 0} \label{eq:TaylorExpansionB }.
\end{align}
By carrying out the calculations,we obtain the following Schr{\"o}dinger equation
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:TaylorExpansionHamiltonian}
	ih\partial_t\psi(z) =
	-h^2\partial_z\left(b_{0}(z)\partial_z\psi(z) \right)+
	\left[ 	\Lambda z^2 - 2b_{0}(z) \right] \psi(z)
\end{equation}
where $ b_{0}(z) = \sqrt{1-z^2}  $.
We can retrieve equation (7) in \cite{FastGenerationJulia2012} by setting a new $ \tilde{h} \equiv h/2 = 1/N $.
In the following we will stick to definition of $ h = 1/N/2 $ instead of using the other definition.\\
The last approximation we need to perform in order to obtain an oscillator-like Schr{\"o}dinger equation for this system is given by neglecting the $ z $ dependence of the effective mass term and expanding the $ \sqrt{1 - z^2}  $ term into $ 1 - z^2/2 $ in the external potential term. We can finally write down the Schr{\"o}dinger equation
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:SchrodingerEquationHarmonicLike}
	ih\partial_t\psi(z) = H_{ho}\psi(z)
\end{equation}
where the Hamiltonian of the system is given by
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:HamiltonianJosephsonJunctionHarmonic}
	H_{ho} = -h^2\partial_z^2 + (1 + \Lambda)z^2  =
	-h^2\partial_z^2 + \frac{1}{4}\omega^2 z^2
\end{equation}
if we set $ \omega^2 \equiv 4(1+\Lambda) $.
\section{eSTA Calculations}

\subsection{Introduction} % Introduction and definitions of the STA wavefunctions  
Now that we managed to approximate the Hamiltonian of the system to \cref{eq:HamiltonianJosephsonJunctionHarmonic} where we can apply an STA protocol, we are in a position to calculate the eSTA corrections as well.
In the eSTA formalism, we need two Hamiltonians:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the Hamiltonian $ \mathcal{H}_{S} $ of the real system
	\item the Hamiltonian $ \mathcal{H}_{0} $ of the idealised version of the system, where STA can be applied
\end{itemize}
and referring to the previous section, we can see that
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:eSTAJJcomparison}
	\mathcal{H}_{0} \rightarrow H_{ho} \hspace{5em} \mathcal{H}_{s} \rightarrow H_{N} .
\end{equation}
We now need the STA wavefunctions for this system and we are going to do that by making some modifications to the ones obtained in \cite{FastOptimalFrChen2010} which are wavefunctions for the harmonic oscillator and are thus defined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:STAWavefunctionHarmonicOscillator}
	\ket{\eta_{n}(z,t)} =
	\left(\frac{m\omega_{0}}{ \pi\hbar}\right)^{1/4} % Normalisation factor
	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}!b} }e^{\left\{-i\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\int_{0}^{t}dt~\omega_{0}/b^2\right\}} % Time dependent phase 
	e^{\left\{ i \frac{m}{2\hbar }\left(\frac{\dot{ b }}{b} + i\frac{\omega_{0}}{b^2}\right)z^2 \right\} } % Spatial Gaussian term 
	H_{n}\left[\left(\sqrt{\frac{m\omega_{0}}{\hbar }} \frac{z}{b}\right)\right] % Hermite polynomial term
	.
\end{equation}
with $ \omega_{0} $ the initial frequency for time $ t = 0 $ and $ b = b(t) $ a polynomial function that is connected to the control parameter $ \omega(t) $ via the Ermakov equation
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:Ermakov}
	\omega^2(t)b(t) + \dot{ b }(t) = \omega_{0}/\dot{b}^{3}(t).
\end{equation}
Finally $ H_n(x) $ is the Hermite polynomial of order $ n $.
We can adapt the wavefunction in \cref{eq:STAWavefunctionHarmonicOscillator} to the Bose Hubbard Hamiltonian by making the substitution
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:SubstitutionHarmonicOscillatorBoseHubbard}
	\hbar \rightarrow h \hspace{5em} m \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}
And obtain the wavefunctions $ \chi_{n}(z,t) $ that are STA solutions for \cref{eq:HamiltonianJosephsonJunctionHarmonic}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:STAWavefunctionBoseHubbard}
	\ket{\chi_{n}(z,t)} =
	\left(\frac{\omega_{0}}{ 2\pi h}\right)^{1/4} % Normalisation factor
	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}!b} }e^{\left\{-i\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\int_{0}^{t}dt~\omega_{0}/b^2\right\}} % Time dependent phase 
	e^{\left\{  \frac{i}{4h }\left(\frac{\dot{ b }}{b} + i\frac{\omega_{0}}{b^2}\right)z^2 \right\} } % Spatial Gaussian term 
	H_{n}\left[\left(\sqrt{\frac{\omega_{0}}{2h }} \frac{z}{b}\right)\right] % Hermite polynomial term
	.
\end{equation}

\subsection{eSTA formulations}\label{sec:eSTAFormulation} % general calculation of the corrections
The wavefunctions \cref{eq:STAWavefunctionBoseHubbard} and the two Hamiltonians are the starting points to evaluate the eSTA corrections.
These corrections are calculated by making approximation about the value of the fidelity landscape and we need to define some variables conveniently.
We will start by defining the variables $G_n$ and $ K_{n} $ that will later be used to calculate the corrections.
If we call $ \chi_{n} $ the nth STA wavefunctions, we can evaluate $ G_n $ with the following formula
\begin{equation}
	G_{n} = \int_{0}^{t_{f}} dt \braket{\chi_{m}|\Delta H |\chi_{0}}
	\label{eq:Gn}
\end{equation}
where $ \Delta H $ is the difference between the original Hamiltonian $ H_{0} $ and the approximated one $ H_{ho} $.
Similarly we can calculate the numbers $ K_{n} $ with
\begin{equation}
	K_{n} = \int_{0}^{t_{f}} dt \braket{\chi_{m}|\vec{\nabla} H|\chi_{0}}
	\label{eq:Kn}
\end{equation}
where $ \vec{\nabla} H$ is the gradient of the Hamiltonian with respect to the control parameter.
To summarize and to put everything in perspective, we have
\begin{itemize}
	\item  $ G_{n} $ as a complex number
	\item  $ K_{n} $ is a vector of complex numbers.
\end{itemize}
In the first formulation of the eSTA protocol, there was an assumptions by virtue of which the optimal fidelity of the protocol has been set to 1.
In this case, the corrections were calculated via:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:eSTAcorrections}
	-\frac
	{
	\left( \sum_{n=1}^{\mathcal{N}} |G_{n}|^2 \right)
	\left[ \sum_{n=1}^{\mathcal{N}}\text{Re}(G_{n}^{*}\vec{K}_{n})\right]
	}
	{\left|\sum_{n=1}^{\mathcal{N}}\text{Re}(G_{n}^{*}\vec{K}_{n})\right|^2 }
\end{equation}
where $ \mathcal{N} $ is the number of STA wavefunctions we take into account.
The assumption of the fidelity being 1 has been deemed to optimistic, and recently a new formalism has been proposed.
In this case, the only assumption is that exists a point where the fidelity hits a local maximum.
If we follow this prescription, the corrections can be calculated via
\begin{equation}
	\frac
	{\vec{v}\norm{v}^{3}}
	{\vec{v}^{T}\mathrm{H}\vec{v}}
	\label{eq:eSTAcorrectionsHessian}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	\vec{v} = \sum_{n=1}^{\mathcal{N}}\text{Re}(G_{n}^{*}\vec{K}_{n})
	\label{eq:FidelityVector}
\end{equation}
and $ \mathrm{H} $ is the Hessian matrix approximation given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{H}_{l,k} = \sum_{n = 1}^{\mathrm{N}}\left[G_{n}(W_{n})_{l,k} - \left(  \vec{K}^{*}_{n} \right)_{k}\left(  \vec{K}_{n} \right)_{l}\right]
	\label{eq:HessianMatrix}
\end{equation}
where we $ W_{n} $ is a matrix evaluated by taking the second derivative with respect of the control parameter.
\subsection{Gn in Josephson Junction}
In order to calculate the eSTA corrections, we need to evalute the difference between the two Hamiltonians
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:DeltaH}
	\Delta H = H_{N} - H_{ho} =
	- e^{-i\hat{p}} b_{h}(z) - b_{h}(z)e^{i\hat{p}} + h^2 \partial_z^2 - z^2
\end{equation}
where we can see that the control parameter $ \omega $ is cancelled out.\\
The correction numbers $ G_{n} $ are found according to \cref{eq:Gn} and since we are only interested in the effects of $ \Delta H  $ when applied to the ground state of the STA wavefunctions $ \ket{\chi_{0}} $, we can expand the exponential parts in \cref{eq:DeltaH} and obtain
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:DeltaHOnGroundState}
	\Delta H \chi_{0}(z,t) = - b_{h}(z-h)\chi_{0}(z-h,t) - b_{h}(z)\chi_{0}(z+h,t) + h^2\partial^2_{z}\chi_{0}(z,t) - z^2\chi_{0}(z,t).
\end{equation}
We can exploit some symmetries of the system in order to avoid calculating some integrals.
In particular due to the parity of the STA wavefunctions \cref{eq:STAWavefunctionBoseHubbard} we can show that both $ G_{2n+1} $ and $ \vec{K}_{2n +1} $ are identically 0 for $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ thus saving us a lot of time and effort.
Moreover, it can be shown that $ \Braket{\chi_{2m}|\partial_z^{2}|\chi_{0} } = \Braket{\chi_{2m}|z^{2}|\chi_{0} } = 0 $ for $ m \neq 1 $.
In addition, we can numerically see that
\begin{equation}
	\int_{0}^{t_{f}} dt
	\Braket{
	\chi_{2m}(z,t)|b_{h}(z-h)\chi_{0}(z-h,t)} =
	\int_{0}^{t_{f}} dt
	\Braket{\chi_{2m}(z,t)|b_{h}(z)\chi_{0}(z+h,t)} = 0
\end{equation}
for each $ m \in \mathbb{N} $.
\subsection{Kn in Josephson Junction}
The quantity $ \vec{ K }_{n} $ can be evaluated using the following formula of \cref{eq:Kn} where $ \nabla H_{N}(\vec{ \lambda }_{0}, t)$ is the gradient of the Hamiltonian of the system with respect to the control parameters.\\
%Adding polynomial
The idea here is to start with the control parameter $ \Lambda $ that works for the STA protocol and add another polynomial $ P_{\vec{\lambda}}(t) $ that would take some values $ \vec{\lambda}  = (\lambda_{1},..., \lambda_{n})$ in the interval for some $ t \in [t_1, t_{n}] $ with $ \lambda_{1} = \lambda_{n} = 0 $, and $ t_{1}  = t_0 , t_{n} = t_{f} $.
We can consider values $ (\lambda_{1},..., \lambda_n) $ as variables and then define a new $ \tilde{\Lambda}(t) = \Lambda(t) +   P_{\vec{\lambda}}(t) $ where $ \nabla H_{N}(\vec{\lambda}_0,t) $ means $ (\partial_{\lambda_1} H_{N},..., \partial_{\lambda_n} H_{N}) $.
Since we want to interpolate just for a limited number of points, it is helpful to use the Lagrange interpolation that would take the form
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:LagrangeInterpolationPolynomial}
	P_{\vec{ \lambda }}(t) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}\lambda_{j}\prod_{\substack{k=1\\k\neq j }}^{n}\frac{t-t_{k}}{t_{j} - t_{k}}.
\end{equation}
It can be simplified even further by recalling that $ \lambda_{1} = \lambda_{n} = 0 $
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:LagrangeInterpolationPolynomialSimplified}
	P_{\vec{ \lambda }}(t) = \sum_{j=2}^{n-1}\lambda_{j}\prod_{\substack{k=2\\k\neq j }}^{n-1}\frac{t-t_{k}}{t_{j} - t_{k}}.
\end{equation}
Recalling the form of $   H_{N} $ from \cref{eq:SchrodingerEquationCoefficientsContinuous} we can see that the only part dependent from $ \lambda_{i} $ is the $ z^2 $ term.
Now taking the gradient of $ H_{N} $ with respect to the control parameters in this case only amounts to perform the following derivatives
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:GradientLambda}
	\partial_{\lambda_i} H_{N}=\partial_{\lambda_i} \tilde{ \Lambda }(t)z = \partial_{\lambda_i} \left(\Lambda z^2 + P_{\vec{ \lambda }}(t)z^2    \right) =z^2\prod_{\substack{k=2\\k\neq i }}^{n-1}\frac{t-t_{k}}{t_{i} - t_{k}}
\end{equation}
We are now in a position to calculate the following quantity
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:KnOverSpace}
	\Braket{\chi_{m}|\partial_{\lambda_i} H_{N}|\chi_{0}} = \prod_{\substack{k=2\\k\neq i }}^{n-1}\frac{t-t_{k}}{t_{i} - t_{k}} \Braket{\chi_{m}|z^2 |\chi_{0}}
\end{equation}
and we can recall that this integral is non-zero only for $ m = 2 $.

\subsection{Final formulation of the corrections in Josephson Junction}
If we apply the results we obtained in the previous section, we can see that the only non zero values are $ \vec{ K }_{2} $ and $ G_{2} $.
In such a way that \cref{eq:FidelityVector} \cref{eq:HessianMatrix} simplify significantly, and we can write
\begin{align}
	 & \vec{v} = \text{Re}(G_{2}^{*}\vec{K}_{2}) \label{eq:FidelityVectorSimple}                                            \\
	 & \mathrm{H}_{l,k} = \left(  \vec{K}^{*}_{2} \right)_{k}\left(  \vec{K}_{2} \right)_{l} \label{eq:HessianMatrixSimple}
\end{align}

\subsection{Useful Integrals} % List of all the properties of the integrals that will help speed up the calculation
For the sake of the argument here we will write down the solution to two of the integrals we need to calculate and which are analytically solvable.
\begin{align}
	%First integral
	 & \Braket{\chi_{2}|z^2|\chi_{0}} =
	\int_{\mathbb{R}}dz \chi_{2}^{*}(z,t) z^2 \chi_{0}(z,t) =
	e^{2i\int_{0}^{t}dt\omega_{0}/b^2 }\frac{\sqrt{2}h b   }{\omega_0} \\
	%Second integral
	 & \Braket{\chi_{2}|\partial_z^2|\chi_{0}} =
	\int_{\mathbb{R}}dz \chi_{2}^{*}(z,t) \partial_z^2 \chi_{0}(z,t)=
	e^{2i\int_{0}^{t}dt\omega_{0}/b^2 }\frac{\left(\omega_0 - ib\dot{b}\right)^2}{ \sqrt{8} h\omega_0b^2 }
\end{align}

\section{Results}
\subsection{Introduction}
In this section we will go through all the tests and results we obtained applying the eSTA protocol to the Josephson Junction system.
We checked the performances of the eSTA approach for both the original formulation of eSTA as well as for the eSTA protocol with the Hessian formalism as explained in \cref{sec:eSTAFormulation}
In addition, we obtained the corrections by applying eSTA to two different Hamiltonians against the reference \cref{eq:HamiltonianJosephsonJunctionHarmonic}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The original Hamiltonian of the Josephson Junction (in its continuous form) \cref{eq:SchrodingerEquationCoefficientsContinuous}
	\item The approximated Hamiltonian \cref{eq:TaylorExpansionHamiltonian}
\end{itemize}
Finally, we also checked how the number of correction paramters affected the performances of the eSTA protocol.
We will start with the fidelity and then we move on and check the robustness with respect to noise.

\subsection{Fidelity}
Here we will use the corrections for different types of Hamiltonian and different eSTA protocols to check how the fidelity is affected by this conditions.
In particular we will use various number of particles to assess the improvement.

\end{center}

As we can see, the best performances are achieved by the Hessian version eSTA protocol.
The fidelities are calculated using 5 $ \lambda $, in the following we will compare the fidelity for different number of corrections.
Since the behaviour of the fidelity is roughly the same regardless of the number of particles, in the following we will focus only on 10 particles as it is the most extreme case.
Moreover, we will use only the protocol that yields the best performance so in this case we will use the eSTA corrections evaluated from the original Hamiltonian and with the Hessian formalism.

\subsection{Robustness}
We will follow the same pattern we used in the previous section, so we will start with the robustness for different number of particles for $ \lambda = 5 $.

\end{center}

Again we can see that the best performances are achieved by the Hessian version of the eSTA protocol when applied to the full Hamiltonian of the system.

\subsection{Sensitivity}
We can also check the performance with this quantity that encompasses both the fidelity as well as the robustness of a protcol.
We are going to define the following quantity
\begin{equation}
	\eta = \sqrt{(1-F)^{2} + R^{2}}
	\label{eq:Sensitivity}
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the fidelity and $ R $  is the robustness.
The results are shown in the following plots for different number of particles and for different eSTA.

Unsurprisingly, increasing the number of $ \lambda $ produces better results.
